# Gallery sizing and prompt visibility

## Goal
Make example images easier to see and improve visual hierarchy around prompt entry.

## Tasks
- [ ] Increase `ExamplesGallery` thumbnail dimensions to closer-to-square tiles so the full artwork is visible without cropping.
- [ ] Verify hover/tooltip prompt labels still show on rollover and remain readable.
- [ ] Revisit surrounding padding/margins to keep the gallery aligned with nearby sections.
