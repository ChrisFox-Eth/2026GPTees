# Account design history completeness

## Goal
Show purchased design thumbnails in account history and allow re-purchase of winning designs.

## Tasks
- [ ] Extend `frontend/src/pages/AccountPage.tsx` (or supporting components) to load image URLs for purchased designs and display thumbnails in the history list.
- [ ] Add a CTA from history items to add the same design back into the cart with selected garment/tier options.
- [ ] Ensure access control still respects ownership and does not expose designs from other users.
