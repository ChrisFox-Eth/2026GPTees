# Cart clarity for repeat adds

## Goal
Make it clear when the user is adding multiple garments of the same design and prevent confusion when re-opening the generator.

## Tasks
- [ ] In `frontend/src/pages/CartPage.tsx` or shared cart UI, surface a notice when a duplicate design is added (e.g., "Added another tee of this design").
- [ ] Add inline messaging near the "Make this yours" entry point to explain repeated clicks will add another garment.
- [ ] Confirm cart counts/pricing update immediately and are reflected in the mobile cart drawer.
