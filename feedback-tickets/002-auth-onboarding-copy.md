# Auth & onboarding clarity

## Goal
Match user expectations when signing in from the generator and clarify when designs become visible.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the Clerk sign-in modal copy to say "Sign in or create your free account" when triggered from generator/checkout entry points.
- [ ] After sign-in redirects to `/shop`, add a prominent banner or intro text noting the user's design is ready and next step is choosing tier/fit before seeing it.
- [ ] Add inline note on the modal/cart flow that after submitting selections the design will appear for approval.
- [ ] Ensure the updated language is visible on both desktop and mobile flows.
