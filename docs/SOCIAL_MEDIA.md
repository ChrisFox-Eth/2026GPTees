GPTees December 2025 Content Strategy (Instagram & Facebook)

In December 2025, GPTees will roll out a daily holiday content campaign across Instagram and Facebook. Each day’s plan below details the post type, visual concept, caption, hashtags, call-to-action, Stories, paid boost ideas, and collaboration opportunities. This “digital advent calendar” approach (one post a day) maximizes festive engagement and keeps our community excited
. All content emphasizes GPTees’ key benefits – speed, personalization, and fun – in a warm, creative tone that invites followers to participate.

December 1, 2025 – Cyber Monday Flash Sale Kickoff

Post Type: Static Image (Promotional Graphic).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A bold, festive graphic announcing “Cyber Monday – One-Day Flash Sale!”. Incorporate holiday elements (snowflakes, ornaments) and highlight a discount (e.g. “10% OFF today only”) in eye-catching text. Possibly include a product image (a model in a GPTees shirt) with a “sale” tag.

Caption Copy: “🎉 Cyber Monday is here! For today only, enjoy 10% off your one-of-a-kind AI-designed tee. ✨ Don’t miss this chance to create a personalized gift at a merry discount – whether it’s a funny quote tee or a cozy holiday design, we’ve got you covered. Hurry, sale ends at midnight! ⏳
On Instagram, tag our shop in the post so users can tap to shop.

Suggested Hashtags: #CyberMonday #HolidayDeals #GPTees #CustomTShirt #OneOfOne #HolidayGifts #Sale (using ~5-8 relevant tags; a mix of high-traffic and brand-specific tags).

CTA: “Design yours now at GPTees.app and use code CYBER at checkout!” – On IG, mention “Link in bio” for the website; on Facebook, include a clickable link to GPTees.app in the post. Encourage immediate action with the limited time offer.

Instagram Story Ideas: Several frames to amplify urgency – e.g., a countdown sticker ticking down to midnight, a “Swipe Up”/Link sticker to the site (or “Tap here to shop” since IG allows link stickers now), and a poll like “What design will you create with 10% off? 🎁” (options: Funny Holiday Tee, Gift for Loved One, Something for Me!). This leverages the 24-hr story window to drive FOMO.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Yes – Boost this post to reach a wider audience of holiday shoppers. Target interests like “custom apparel,” “holiday shopping,” and lookalikes of past customers. A one-day ad with the promo code can spur quick conversions (since “deals drive dollars” on Instagram). Allocate a modest budget (e.g. $50-$100) on IG & FB for Cyber Monday.

Collaboration Ideas: If possible, partner with a micro-influencer in the gifting or fashion niche to share the deal (perhaps an influencer creates their own GPTees shirt with the discount and posts about it). Offer them an affiliate code or free tee for participation. User-generated content can amplify reach (86% of millennials trust UGC for brand quality), so encourage followers to share this sale in their Stories for a chance to win a free shirt.

December 2, 2025 – “Gift Guide” Carousel (Personalized Gifts)

Post Type: Carousel (multi-image post).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A 3-5 image carousel showcasing “Personalized Gift Ideas” using GPTees. Each card could target a different recipient: e.g., Card 1: “For Dad – Vintage car art tee from your prompt”, with an image of a retro car tee; Card 2: “For Bestie – Inside joke meme tee”, with a fun design; Card 3: “For Partner – Romantic quote or artwork tee” with hearts, etc. Use bright, cozy holiday backgrounds on each slide (think gift wrapping paper or twinkling lights behind the shirt).

Caption Copy: “🎁 Holiday Gift Guide: There’s nothing quite like a custom-made surprise! Here are 3 one-of-a-kind gift ideas you can create with GPTees:
1️⃣ For Dad: Turn his favorite hobby into a tee (how about a classic car sketch or his go-to catchphrase?).
2️⃣ For Your BFF: Design an inside-joke shirt that only you two understand – friendship goals! 🙌
3️⃣ For Someone Special: Upload a meaningful photo or let our AI illustrate your favorite memory together. ❤️
With GPTees, you can whip up heartfelt gifts in seconds – no art skills needed. Which idea sparks your creativity?”

Suggested Hashtags: #GiftGuide #PersonalizedGifts #CustomApparel #HolidayGiftIdeas #GPTees #MadeJustForYou #Christmas2025. (Combines popular gift hashtags with brand-specific tags to increase discoverability.)

CTA: “Design a unique gift now at GPTees.app – make it truly special!” Encourage readers to swipe through the carousel and then click the link in bio (IG) or link in post (FB) to start designing gifts. Possibly add: “Order by Dec 15 to ensure Christmas delivery!” as an early reminder.

Instagram Story Ideas: Turn the gift guide into interactive Stories. For each gift idea, post a story panel with a photo of the example tee and use a poll sticker: “Would you gift this to [Dad/BFF/Partner]? Yes/No”. Follow up with a question sticker: “Who are you designing a GPTees gift for?” to prompt DMs or replies (great for engagement and gauging interest). Feature a “Gift Guide” highlight on IG to save these ideas.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Moderate – Consider boosting one of the carousel cards (or remixing into a single-image ad) as a targeted ad for people interested in “gifts for him/her” or “personalized gifts.” This post has broad appeal for gift shoppers, so a small ad spend could attract new customers looking for unique present ideas.

Collaboration Ideas: Invite followers to contribute their own gift ideas: e.g., “Comment with a prompt you’d use for a friend’s tee – we might design it and feature it!”. This user collaboration sparks ideas and provides potential content for later posts (UGC). Additionally, you could partner with a complementary brand (e.g., a custom mug or card company) for a joint gift guide – one slide could feature their product and they feature GPTees, cross-promoting to each other’s audiences.

December 3, 2025 – Customer Testimonial / UGC Highlight

Post Type: Static Image or Carousel (Testimonial).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A quote graphic or a user photo. Option 1: Design a nicely formatted quote card with a real customer review (e.g., “I typed a prompt and GPTees brought it to life – fastest gift I’ve ever made!”). Use festive typography and maybe a small profile pic of the customer (if permission given) or a photo of the shirt they received. Option 2: Carousel with the first slide showing the quote text on a decorative background, and the next slide showing the actual shirt or the customer wearing it (UGC photo). Ensure it looks warm and authentic – perhaps overlay the quote on a subtle holiday background (like a blurred Christmas tree).

Caption Copy: “🗣️ From our GPTees community: ‘I designed a tee for my brother in 2 minutes, and it came out PERFECT! 🎨👕 I’ve never seen him laugh so hard opening a gift.’ – @jane_doe ✨ (We’re blushing! 😇)
Nothing makes us happier than seeing your one-of-one creations out in the world. Thank you for sharing your stories and creativity with us! If you’ve made a GPTees shirt, drop a comment or pic – we might feature you next. 💕

Suggested Hashtags: #CustomerLove #Testimonial #HappyCustomer #UGC #GPTeesStory #OneOfOne #CustomTShirt. (Using UGC-related tags and brand tags to build trust – UGC content is highly trusted by peers.)

CTA: “Design your own and join the fun at GPTees.app!” plus “Tag us @GPTees in your photos to be featured.” Encourage readers to not only visit the site but also to share their results. On Facebook, you can directly ask for photo replies in comments (“Share your GPTees creation in the comments!”) since that platform allows it, increasing engagement.

Instagram Story Ideas: Share the testimonial in Stories with a sweet animation (e.g., animated hearts or confetti). Use the quote sticker or simply screenshot the post. Add a “Thank you, [Name]!” mention of the customer. Then use a question sticker: “What would your dream tee say or show?” – followers can submit answers, and you can later turn some into actual designs to share, fueling more UGC. Perhaps create a dedicated Story Highlight like “💡 Customer Stories” to archive these.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This post is more about community and trust-building. If it’s a particularly compelling testimonial, you could boost it to lookalike audiences to showcase social proof, but it might be better kept organic. Alternatively, incorporate this testimonial as a slide in a retargeting ad (for people who visited the site but didn’t purchase), since seeing a real positive review can tip them to convert.

Collaboration Ideas: This is a collaboration with our customer! Consider turning this into a UGC campaign: invite more users to share their designs. Perhaps announce that the “Top 5 tagged posts” this month will get a free shirt or be featured in a year-end collage. Additionally, engage staff by having a team member pick a “favorite customer design of the week” to feature (showing the human side of the brand). This fosters a community vibe where customers and the brand co-create content.

December 4, 2025 – Behind-the-Scenes Reel (How GPTees Works)

Post Type: Reel (short-form vertical video, ~30 seconds).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A fast-paced behind-the-scenes montage titled “From Prompt to Tee in 24 Hours!”. Film clips of each stage: typing a prompt into the GPTees app (screen recording of the interface with a fun prompt input like “snowman surfing” being entered), a quick flash of the AI generating art, then footage in the print shop – printer printing the shirt, someone (perhaps a team member in a Santa hat) packing it into a shipping envelope, and finally a happy customer unboxing or wearing the shirt. Use upbeat, festive music (royalty-free holiday hip-hop or jingle bells remix) to keep it engaging. Add captions/text overlay for each step: “1️⃣ Prompt → 🎨 AI Magic → 👕 Print → 📦 Ship (in 1 day!)”.

Caption Copy: “Ever wonder how your GPTees shirt goes from an idea to reality? 🤔 Here’s a little behind-the-scenes magic: We take your prompt, our AI cooks up art in seconds, then we print it on a cozy tee and ship it out – sometimes the same day! 🚀 Talk about a one-of-a-kind gift, made lightning fast. ⚡️
From our team (hi from the workshop 👋) to your doorstep, we’re working hard to make your holiday gifts special. This is #HowItsMade at GPTees – powered by tech, but made with love. ❤️”

Suggested Hashtags: #BehindTheScenes #HowItsMade #GPTees #StartupLife #HolidayOrders #MadeWithAI #FastShipping. (BTS content boosts authenticity – 72% of people say seeing behind-the-scenes makes them trust a brand more, so these tags flag genuine content).

CTA: “Try it yourself – give us a prompt at GPTees.app and watch the magic happen!” On IG, mention link in bio; on FB, direct link. Possibly also “Order by Dec 15 to get your gift by Christmas.” (reinforcing that key deadline with our fast turnaround).

Instagram Story Ideas: Tease the Reel on Stories: share a clip or boomerang of the printing process with a “New Reel” sticker and a link to watch it. Add a fun quiz: “How fast do you think we can print a tee after you order? 🤔” with multiple choice (e.g., “Same day”, “1-2 days”, “A week”). After the quiz, reveal the answer in the next story (“🎉 It can be as fast as same day!”) and encourage them to check out the full Reel. You could also use the countdown sticker for the shipping cutoff date here to subtly remind viewers.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Moderate – This authentic content can double as a great ad. Consider running it as a targeted Reel ad to cold audiences interested in “t-shirts”, “AI art”, or “gifts”. The engaging BTS nature could stop the scroll. Also use it in retargeting (people who visited site) to reinforce trust with how quick & real our process is. Allocate a small budget to test, and if it gets good engagement (views, replay), scale it up.

Collaboration Ideas: Feature team members: perhaps in the Reel, a quick cameo of a staff waving or saying hi. This “meet the makers” feel adds warmth. Tag the team member if they’re comfortable (on Facebook, you can mention first names, e.g., “Our print wizard, Alice, ensures quality!”). You could also collaborate with a partner printing company or equipment provider if any (e.g., tag the printer brand in the post — they might reshare it). Additionally, invite customers: “Want to see something else behind the scenes? Tell us what to film next!” – letting the audience guide future BTS content.

December 5, 2025 – Trending Holiday Designs (Carousel)

Post Type: Carousel (user-inspired designs showcase).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A series of slides each featuring a trending or fun design created on GPTees this season. For example: Slide 1: an “Ugly Christmas Sweater” style t-shirt generated by AI (with gaudy sweater pattern printed on a tee – a fun twist); Slide 2: a cute snowman or reindeer cartoon tee (popular whimsical design); Slide 3: an artsy New Year 2026 fireworks design. Each image should be high-quality – use mockups or real photos if available. Add a small text label on each slide like “Popular 🔥” or “Trending Design”. If possible, include the prompt that inspired it in a small caption on the image (e.g., “Prompt: ‘cat in ugly xmas sweater’ →”).

Caption Copy: “🎨 Trending Designs Alert! Our GPTees creators have been busy making some incredible one-of-one shirts. 🙌 Here are a few holiday faves we’re loving:
⭐ Ugly Sweater Tee: Who says you need wool? One of you prompted an AI-generated “ugly sweater” print on a tee – and it’s delightfully tacky 🎉.
🎅 Whimsical Santa: This cute Santa and snowman illustration came from a single sentence prompt – talk about merry and bright! ✨
*🎆 New Year’s Sparkle: Already looking to 2026, this firework art tee is giving us all the New Year vibes. 🎊
From festive and funny to artsy and awesome, GPTees is seeing it all. Which design would you wear? Tell us your fave, or drop an idea for the next big trend!”

Suggested Hashtags: #Trending #HolidayDesigns #CustomTShirt #UglyChristmasSweater (if showcasing that) #AIArt #GPTees #CreativeFashion #WinterStyle. (Mix general trend tags with niche ones like #AIArt and our brand tag for reach and relevance.)

CTA: “Create your own trending design at GPTees.app – it only takes a few words to start!” Encourage experimentation: “Your idea might be our next feature!”. On Facebook, you could directly ask readers to share a prompt in comments that you’ll turn into a design. On IG, push them to link in bio to try it out.

Instagram Story Ideas: Convert this into an interactive story series: post each design image in a Story with a poll – “Hot or Not? Would you wear this Ugly Sweater tee? 👍👎”. Use the slider sticker with 🔥 emoji for “How much do you love this design?” on each. After showing all, final story asks “What design should we try next? Share a prompt!” using the question sticker. This not only engages but also crowdsources content ideas.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This is more community-driven content. You might boost one standout design image to a broader audience with a caption like “This fun ‘ugly sweater’ tee was AI-designed by a user! Imagine what you’d create…”, as an inspirational ad. But it’s not a direct product ad, so boosting is optional unless engagement is high. If one design resonates strongly (lots of comments like “I need this!”), consider using that in an ad or even making it a limited offering.

Collaboration Ideas: Highlight user creativity – perhaps reach out to the users (if known) who inspired these designs and tag them (with permission) to give credit. Collab with users by featuring their imagination. This encourages others to participate. Additionally, this could tie into an influencer idea: challenge a friendly influencer, “Hey @TechArtistJane, give us a crazy prompt – we’ll feature the result!” and post their prompted design. It’s a low-effort collab for the influencer that showcases the fun of GPTees.

December 6, 2025 – Holiday Humor Meme Post

Post Type: Static Image (Meme-style graphic).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A lighthearted holiday meme related to last-minute gifting or the fun of AI-generated shirts. For example, a popular meme format like the Distracted Boyfriend: boyfriend (labeled “Me with no gift on Dec 23”) turning toward a girl labeled “GPTees instant custom tee” while annoyed girlfriend (labeled “panicked shopping”) looks on – something humorous that implies GPTees saves the day. Alternatively, a text post styled humorously: “’Twas the week before Christmas, and all through the house, not a gift could be found… until someone whispered: GPTees.app 😉”. Use bold, easy-to-read text and maybe a funny image of Santa using a computer or an elf printing a shirt.

Caption Copy: “😂 Holiday meme time! Because who hasn’t been that last-minute shopper? (Guilty! 🙋‍♂️)
If you still need gifts, remember GPTees has your back – no mall lines, no stress, just instant custom shirts from your couch. Consider this your friendly meme reminder to get those presents wrapped up! 🎁✨
Tag a friend who would appreciate this 😂👇”

Suggested Hashtags: #HolidayMeme #FunnyFriday (if Fri) #LastMinuteShopping #Procrastination #GPTees #HolidayHumor #Relatable. (Using humor and trending meme tags to appear in lighter content feeds).

CTA: “Beat the last-minute rush at GPTees.app – design a gift in minutes.” The CTA is subtle here since the meme is more for engagement, but still invites action. On Facebook, you could include the link in the comments with a wink like “(Psst… for real though: GPTees.app if you need it!)”.

Instagram Story Ideas: Share the meme on Stories with a funny sticker (like a laughing emoji GIF) and a poll: “Are you a last-minute shopper? 😅” (Options: “Every year 🙈” vs. “Nope, I’m on top of it”). Then a second story: “What’s the latest you’ve ever bought a gift? 🤷” using the question sticker to get humorous answers from followers. Repost the best answers (people love seeing their response shared).

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Very low – Memes are best for organic virality. However, if this meme really resonates (high shares/save counts), you might repurpose it in a broader engagement ad for brand awareness (targeting a young demographic that responds to memes). Typically, keep it organic and let followers share it to spread the word.

Collaboration Ideas: Encourage user interaction by perhaps running a “caption this” contest in the comments for the meme image: invite followers to come up with their own funny caption or holiday rhyme. This gets them involved (and could give ideas for future posts). Also, if you have any comedic influencers or meme pages in your niche, tag them or send it to them – they might share if they find it funny, which can amplify reach. (Just ensure the humor is on-brand and universally safe.)

December 7, 2025 – Shipping Deadline Reminder (Graphic)

Post Type: Static Image (Informational Graphic).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A clear, branded deadline reminder graphic. For example, an image of a calendar marked on Dec 15 with a big red circle or an alarm clock icon, plus text like “🎄 Order by Dec 15 for Christmas Delivery!” Include the GPTees logo or mascot (if any) wearing a Santa hat for a festive touch. You can also show a package with a bow heading out the door. Use bold colors (GPTees brand colors + red/green for holiday) so the message is unmissable.

Caption Copy: “🚚 Heads up, holiday shoppers! To get your custom tees under the tree by Christmas, order by Dec 15. Our elves (okay, they’re awesome humans 😇) are working hard to print & ship your shirts lightning-fast, but we want to make sure Santa’s sleigh (and the postal service) have enough time! 🎅💨
Pro Tip: That’s one week away – if you have a gift idea brewing, now’s the time to let GPTees bring it to life. Don’t wait until the last minute (we’ve all been there)! 😉

Suggested Hashtags: #ShippingDeadline #HolidayPlanning #DontMissOut #GPTees #FastShipping #ChristmasDelivery. (A mix to catch people searching about holiday shipping and to reinforce brand).

CTA: “Design & order your custom tee by 12/15 at GPTees.app for on-time delivery.” Encourage immediate action by emphasizing the cutoff. On Instagram, say “Link in bio to start designing”; on Facebook, include the link. Possibly offer “(P.S. Need a last-second gift after that? We have digital gift cards!)” if applicable, to cover beyond the deadline.

Instagram Story Ideas: Do a countdown sticker labeled “Christmas Order Deadline” counting down to Dec 15 midnight. Post a story with the same key message as the graphic (maybe literally repost the graphic to Stories for visibility), and add an alarm bell GIF. Also, a poll: “Have you finished your holiday shopping? 🎁” (Options: “Almost!” / “Not even close!”). For those who answer not close, follow up with “We feel you – remember our deadline for tees is coming up 👆”. Possibly pin this info in an IG Highlight “Holiday Info”.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Yes – boost this informational post to ensure more followers (and new eyes in your target market) see this important update. Especially target areas where shipping is relevant (e.g., US-only if you only ship there). The goal isn’t conversions per se but to avoid customer disappointment and gently push fence-sitters to buy now. A small spend on both IG and FB can dramatically increase awareness of the deadline.

Collaboration Ideas: Internally, coordinate with customer service to share this post if people ask about shipping (it’s handy info). For an external collab angle, maybe team up with a shipping partner or local postal service account for a fun PSA (if feasible) – or simply tag #USPS #HolidayShipping in Stories to join the conversation. Also, consider an employee shout-out in this context: e.g. in caption or a follow-up comment, “Shout out to our fulfillment lead, John, and team for hustling on all your orders!” This humanizes the brand and implicitly tells customers “real people are ensuring your gifts arrive.”

December 8, 2025 – “Design Challenge” Engagement Post

Post Type: Static Image or Illustrated Graphic (Announcement style).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A colorful graphic with the title “GPTees Holiday Design Challenge!”. Use an image of a blank t-shirt template with a question mark or Christmas decor around it. Maybe have icons like a light bulb 💡, a gift 🎁, and a t-shirt to symbolize idea-to-shirt. If possible, incorporate examples of the prize (e.g., “Win a free tee!” text if that’s the prize). Ensure the rules or prompt is also visible: e.g., “Comment your wildest t-shirt idea 🎨 – we’ll pick one to make live!” in smaller text.

Caption Copy: “🎉 Holiday Design Challenge! 🎉 We want to see your most creative t-shirt idea. How to enter: Comment with a fun, crazy or heartwarming prompt for a holiday tee. We’ll choose our favorite idea, bring it to life with GPTees, and send the winner the shirt for FREE! 🙌👕
Whether it’s “Santa surfing in Hawaii” 🏄‍♂️🎅 or “New Year’s dragon fireworks” 🐉🎆 – let your imagination run wild. This is your chance to play designer!
Enter by Dec 10. Winner announced Dec 12. Ready... set... DESIGN (in the comments)! 💡👇

Suggested Hashtags: #DesignChallenge #GPTeesContest #HolidayContest #CreativeChallenge #AIArt #CustomDesign #Giveaway. (Including contest/giveaway tags can attract engagement, but avoid overused giveaway spam tags; focus on creativity and brand-specific ones).

CTA: “Comment your idea below & follow @GPTees to enter!” – Since this is an engagement post, the CTA is about commenting and following (growth hack). On Facebook, ask people to comment their idea too. After contest, the CTA for general audience: “Even if you don’t win, you can always bring your idea to life at GPTees.app anytime!”.

Instagram Story Ideas: Promote the challenge on Stories daily until deadline: e.g., Day 1 story: an animated text “Holiday Design Challenge 🎨🏆” and a prompt to “DM us your idea or comment on our post!”. Use the question sticker as another entry method: “What’s a crazy tee idea you have?” and note that responses via sticker also count (then you can repost some to hype it up). A countdown sticker to the entry deadline (Dec 10) can remind people. On Dec 12, do a big reveal story: show the winning prompt and the resulting shirt design (exciting reveal with confetti GIFs), plus tag the winner.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Minimal – Usually giveaways spread organically if exciting. However, you might boost it to your followers or a lookalike audience to ensure it reaches more people who already interact with custom apparel. The goal is engagement, so high reach within interested folks is good. Keep budget small and duration short (boost from Dec 8–10 only).

Collaboration Ideas: This is inherently collaborative with your community. You could also involve an influencer or a partner as a judge: e.g., “Our friend [Influencer Name] (who loves custom tees) will help us pick the winner!” – they might share it to their audience, bringing new participants. Or partner with a popular art community group/page by asking them to invite their followers to participate. Finally, collaborate with the winner: after making the winning tee, feature the story of the winner – maybe an interview or a testimonial from them when they receive it, which becomes content for later in the month.

December 9, 2025 – Influencer Collaboration Spotlight

Post Type: Reel or Static Image (Collab Introduction).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: If doing a Reel: a split-screen or stitched video of a micro-influencer unboxing or wearing their GPTees shirt, combined with some shots of the shirt design itself. If static: a well-composed photo of the influencer sporting the custom tee they designed, with a caption overlay like “Collab: @InfluencerName x GPTees”. Ensure it looks authentic and not overly polished – the influencer’s style should shine. For example, if the influencer is an artist, maybe show them sketching an idea that GPTees turned into a shirt. If they’re a fashion blogger, show them styling the tee in a holiday outfit.

Caption Copy: “🤝 Collab Alert! We teamed up with @InfluencerName to create a one-of-a-kind tee! [Name] dreamed up a design – “Winter Galaxy Cat” – and we brought it to life with GPTees. 🐱✨
Check out the results in the video/photos! We love how they styled it with a cozy cardigan for the holidays. ❤️
Hear what [Name] had to say: “I had so much fun using GPTees – I literally typed ‘galaxy cat in an ugly Christmas sweater’ and got my new favorite shirt in the mail two days later! 🎄🚀”
Give @InfluencerName some love and let us know – what would you design if you could do a collab? 😊

Suggested Hashtags: #GPTeesCollab #InfluencerCollab #PartnerPost #OneOfOne #CustomFashion #HolidayStyle #AIxFashion. (Including both brand collab tags and those touching on the tech/fashion angle to draw interest).

CTA: “Follow @InfluencerName to see more of their creative styles, and visit GPTees.app to make your own collab-worthy creation!” – Leverage the influencer’s audience by encouraging mutual follows. Also, on Facebook, tag the influencer’s page and encourage sharing. Possibly include a limited promo code the influencer has (if that was arranged) like “Use code GALAXYCAT for 10% off your order (valid this week only)!” to track influencer-driven sales.

Instagram Story Ideas: Coordinate with the influencer: have them do an IG Story takeover or share BTS of the creation process on their Stories. On GPTees’ own Story, post snippets of the collab: e.g., an unboxing clip with the influencer’s reaction (if available), a close-up of the tee, and a swipe up (or link sticker) to a blog or page about the collab or directly to GPTees. Include a Q&A sticker: “Ask @InfluencerName about their GPTees collab!” – then have the influencer answer a couple of follower questions in your Stories (or theirs) for added engagement. Save these in a “Collabs” Highlight.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Moderate – You can turn this collab content into a sponsored ad, targeting the influencer’s lookalike audience. This is essentially social proof – someone people follow endorsing your product. Since 90% of shoppers trust recommendations from peers/influencers over brand ads, this kind of content can be powerful. Run it as a Story ad or Reel ad with a CTA “Shop Now” leading to GPTees.app. Also, the influencer might boost it on their end if it’s an official partnership (using IG’s paid partnership tagging). Coordinate budgets if applicable.

Collaboration Ideas: This whole post is a collaboration highlight. To extend it: consider doing an IG Live with the influencer (e.g., a short live session where they talk about the design process or even do a live prompt generation for fun). Cross-post the collab content to Facebook and even to TikTok if you have a presence, maximizing reach. Also, encourage the influencer to engage with comments on your post – their replies will further boost visibility.

December 10, 2025 – Product Feature: “Mystery Tee” Explainer

Post Type: Carousel or Short Video (Educational/Product feature).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: If carousel: use the format to explain how GPTees works in 3 steps, since some new followers from recent promo might need clarity. Slide 1: “1️⃣ You Prompt” with an image of someone typing on the website (perhaps a smartphone view with the prompt input visible); Slide 2: “2️⃣ We Generate Art” showing a cool AI-generated design appearing (maybe an animation or just an image sequence); Slide 3: “3️⃣ We Print & Ship” showing a package or a shirt being printed/packed; Slide 4: Show a happy customer wearing the final shirt. Use icons (💡 for idea, 🎨 for art, 📦 for delivery) on each slide for quick visual cues. If video: create a simplified animated explainer ~20 seconds covering the same points.

Caption Copy: “❓ What’s a GPTees Mystery Tee? It’s simple:
Step 1: You write a fun prompt (anything from your favorite quote to “dinosaur in a Santa hat”🦖🎅).
Step 2: Our AI instantly transforms it into a unique piece of art.
Step 3: We print it on a high-quality tee and ship it to you – fast!
The best part? It’s a surprise 🤩 – you won’t see the art until the tee arrives at your door (unless you sneak a peek at the digital proof, but where’s the fun in that?). It’s like a holiday mystery gift you made for yourself (or someone lucky)! 🎁
If you’re new here (hi! 👋), that’s how we turn your ideas into wearable art. Got questions? Drop ’em below! And if you’re ready to try, we’re ready to create 😎👕.*

Suggested Hashtags: #HowGPTeesWorks #MysteryTee #AIArt #TechPowered #CustomTShirt #HolidayGifts #NewHere. (Mix of product-specific and general tags to catch those curious about AI in fashion.)

CTA: “Try creating a Mystery Tee now at GPTees.app – what will your prompt be?” This explicitly invites conversion by trying the product. For Facebook, include a direct link and perhaps a first comment with link and any FAQ page link. Also encourage “DM us if you have any questions about how it works!” to open communication lines.

Instagram Story Ideas: Do a quick Stories version of “How it works”: 3 consecutive story cards or clips labeled 1-2-3 matching the steps, with the final frame a link sticker “Design your tee now”. Use the question sticker for “Confused about how GPTees works? Ask us!” and then answer common questions in the next stories (basically an AMA/FAQ in story form). Save these to a “How It Works” Highlight for newcomers.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Yes – This is great educational content to boost to new audiences who might have seen an ad or heard of GPTees but aren’t clear on the concept. Use it as a mid-funnel ad targeting people who engaged with previous posts or visited the site (explainer to push them closer to trying). Also, a carousel explaining a product can be a good Facebook Ad format – each card could even be clickable if it were an ad with different landing links (though here probably single link is fine). Ensure the caption in the ad version is tight and the headline clear (“Your Prompt = A One-of-a-Kind Tee”).

Collaboration Ideas: Internally, collaborate with the tech team or founder for a short quote or fun fact to include (e.g., “This AI was trained on X images!” or “We’ve generated over 1,000 designs so far”). Externally, if there are any tech bloggers or communities (Reddit, etc.) that might find this concept cool, share this explainer content with them. Or run a short collab with a tech influencer who could duet/react to the “how it works” Reel on their platform, giving an outside perspective on how cool the idea is. This spreads awareness beyond just our channels.

December 11, 2025 – Styling Tip Series: Outfit a GPTees Shirt

Post Type: Carousel (Fashion styling tips).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A mini lookbook: Show how to style a GPTees t-shirt in cozy holiday outfits. For example: Slide 1: GPTees shirt under a flannel plaid shirt with jeans (caption “Casual Cozy 🎄”); Slide 2: Same tee dressed up with a blazer and skirt or festive necklace (“Holiday Party Chic ✨”); Slide 3: Tee layered with an ugly sweater cardigan or worn over a turtleneck (“Layered Fun 😎”). Use real photos with models if possible, or flatlay outfits with the tee. Each image should have a small text overlay naming the look. This not only showcases the product (the tee) but also adds value with fashion advice.

Caption Copy: “👕 3 Ways to Style Your GPTees Shirt This Holiday:
1️⃣ Cozy Casual: Pair your custom tee with a flannel or hoodie, comfy jeans, and fuzzy boots. Perfect for movie night by the fire or wrapping gifts. 🔥
2️⃣ Festive Chic: Dress it up! Tuck your tee into a sparkly skirt or throw on a blazer. Add a statement necklace – suddenly your fun tee is party-ready. ✨
3️⃣ Layered Laughs: Wear your tee over a contrasting turtleneck or under the ugliest Christmas sweater for extra layers of humor and warmth. Ugly Sweater Day, we see you! 😉
Your one-of-one shirt isn’t just unique art – it’s also versatile fashion. Which style would you rock? Let us know! 🎁

Suggested Hashtags: #StyleTips #HolidayFashion #OOTD (Outfit of the Day) #GPTees #CasualStyle #PartyStyle #UglySweaterDay. (Tap into fashion tags and the Ugly Sweater Day trend since that’s coming up Dec 19.)

CTA: “Need a custom tee to complete your holiday look? Create yours now at GPTees.app!” Also, “Show us how YOU style it – tag @GPTees in your outfit pics.” This encourages content creation from customers. On Facebook, you could explicitly invite photo posts (“Share a pic in the comments if you’ve got a GPTees outfit!”).

Instagram Story Ideas: Make it interactive: post each style as a story slide with a poll – “Would you wear this look? Yes/Maybe not my style.” Include swipe-up or link stickers after the last look: “Design a tee for your perfect holiday outfit.” Perhaps also a this-or-that poll: side-by-side images of Look 1 vs Look 2 with “Which is your vibe?” to get viewers engaged. Save these as a “Style Tips” Highlight.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This is more engagement/content value. If one look is particularly popular, you could boost that image with a tagline like “A custom tee can fit any style – see how GPTees shirts elevate your holiday wardrobe.” But generally, keep as organic content to give your feed variety. If you have a fashion-oriented audience segment, maybe target them with this for awareness that GPTees isn’t just a gag gift but a fashion piece too.

Collaboration Ideas: Partner with a fashion blogger or stylist for this post. Perhaps @LocalFashionGuru contributes the styling tips (co-create the carousel). Tag them – they might share with their followers. Or even simpler, collaborate with your own customers: find 2-3 customers who have posted pics in GPTees styled cool, and feature them (with permission) as the examples in the carousel (real user style). That’s both UGC and fashion content. Another idea: run a small contest in the caption – “Vote for your favorite style by commenting 1, 2, or 3. We’ll randomly pick a voter to win a $25 gift card!” to boost comments.

December 12, 2025 – Winner Announcement & Design Reveal

Post Type: Static Image or Short Video (Contest Winner Reveal).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: If the design challenge (from Dec 8) was run, now is the time to reveal the winner. Show the winning t-shirt design prominently. For example, a mockup of the tee with the artwork, plus text overlay like “Winner: @username!” and maybe a small excerpt of their prompt. Use celebratory graphics (confetti, trophy 🏆, etc.). If doing a short video/Reel: show the text of the winning prompt, then dramatically reveal the art on the shirt (could be a cool transition effect or just a pan over the shirt), and a congratulations message. Background music: upbeat and triumphant.

Caption Copy: “🏆 We have a winner! 🏆 Big congrats to @winnerhandle – your prompt “[prompt text]” won our Holiday Design Challenge! 🎨🙌 Check out the awesome tee we made from your idea in the photo/video. How cool is that?!
Our team had a blast bringing this idea to life (it’ll be on its way to you ASAP, [Name] – we hope you love it!).
Thank you to everyone who participated – we got so many creative prompts, we might have to do this again. 😉 Until then, you don’t have to wait for another contest… you can turn your own idea into reality anytime at GPTees.app. Keep that imagination flowing! 💡✨

Suggested Hashtags: #DesignChallenge #Winner #GPTees #CreativeCommunity #Congrats #WinnerDesign #AIArt. (These tags highlight the contest aspect and celebrate the community’s creativity.)

CTA: “Love this design? Show @winnerhandle some love and drop a 🎉 in the comments! Got your own idea? Head to GPTees.app and make it happen!” – The CTA wraps up the contest and redirects everyone else to try the product. Also, encourage non-winners by saying essentially, “you can still make your idea even if it didn’t win.” On Facebook, you can tag the winner’s profile if possible and thank participants there as well.

Instagram Story Ideas: Do a story series announcing the winner: first story “And the winner is...” with drumroll GIF, then reveal @winnerhandle and their prompt, then show the resulting shirt (perhaps a quick unboxing video if you have it, or a photo). Tag the winner. Use a celebratory emoji slider – “How awesome is this idea? 🎨” with a slider. Finally, a story linking to GPTees.app: “Didn’t win? You can still create your dream tee – tap here!”. Possibly also share a few “honorable mentions” prompts in Stories (text posts listing a couple of cool ideas that were runners-up) to make more participants feel seen.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This is community content, so keep it organic. However, sharing this as an organic post is great for social proof that people are actively engaging with GPTees. If it garnered a lot of excitement, you could include the winning design as an example in future ads (e.g., “See this fun design? It came from a customer’s imagination!”). But no need to boost the announcement itself beyond your followers.

Collaboration Ideas: This closes the loop on the earlier collab with the community. You might collaborate further by inviting the winner to share a photo wearing the shirt when they receive it (that can be a later post or story around end of December – user spotlight). Also, if the winning idea is really appealing, you might consider making it a limited edition offering on the site (with the winner’s blessing) – a fun way to say “designed by a member of our community” and maybe share any proceeds with them or a charity of their choice. Mention in collaboration that “we loved this so much, we’re exploring ways to feature more community designs in our shop – stay tuned!” to hint at future opportunities.

December 13, 2025 – Weekend Giveaway: Tag & Win

Post Type: Static Image (Giveaway Announcement).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A festive graphic with big text “Weekend Giveaway!” and an image of a GPTees shirt gift-wrapped or peeking out of a stocking. Maybe include “Win a Free Custom Tee” as sub-text. Use bright colors and holiday elements (stars, ribbons). Ensure the steps to enter are visible in simple form (e.g., icons for like, follow, tag). For example, show a 1-2-3 list: 1️⃣ Follow, 2️⃣ Like, 3️⃣ Tag a friend. Visual clarity is key so people scrolling catch that it’s a giveaway.

Caption Copy: “🎁 Weekend Giveaway Time! 🎁 We’re feeling the holiday spirit and want to gift one lucky follower a FREE custom GPTees shirt (your design, our treat!). Here’s how to enter:
1️⃣ Follow @GPTees (if you aren’t already 😉)
2️⃣ Like this post
3️⃣ Tag a friend in the comments who would love a one-of-one tee (each comment = 1 entry, tag as many as you’d like!)
Bonus: Share this post to your Story and tag us for 5 extra entries! 🤫
We’ll randomly pick 1 winner on Monday (Dec 15). Open to [your country] only. No purchase necessary. This is our little thank-you for all the support. ❤️ Good luck and happy tagging!

Suggested Hashtags: #Giveaway #Contest #Freebie #GPTeesGiveaway #HolidayGiveaway #CustomTShirt. (These will put the post on the radar of giveaway enthusiasts, but the real spread will come from people tagging friends.)

CTA: The instructions are the CTA (follow/like/tag). Additionally: “Check your DMs on 12/15 – we’ll message the winner directly from this account.” This sets expectation and also subtly hints “follow so you can be notified”. On Facebook, adjust entry method: maybe “Share this post and comment to enter” since FB culture differs (or use a tool like comment picker).

Instagram Story Ideas: Promote the giveaway on Story each day over the weekend: “Don’t forget to enter our giveaway!” with the graphic or a simplified text. Possibly do a countdown sticker to when the contest ends (Dec 15 noon, for instance). Also, after posting, share some of the funniest friend tags to Stories (e.g., someone tags a friend with a comment “we need matching AI shirts!” – share that with a “😄 Love this!”). This shows activity and encourages more tagging.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Generally, do not boost pure “tag & win” giveaways – paid ads might violate some ad policies and can attract low-quality followers. Keep it organic. The virality comes from people tagging others. You could, however, run a small targeted ad to followers to make sure your existing fans see it (since not all see every post due to algorithms). But likely not needed if engagement picks up.

Collaboration Ideas: Use this chance to collaborate with those tagged: you’ll get an influx of new eyes from friends being tagged. Engage in comments actively (reply in a fun way to tags). Also, if you have partner brands, you could have sweetened the deal by including something from them (e.g., “win a tee + a mug from @OtherBrand”). If not this time, consider that for future collabs. Finally, collaborate with your internal team to ensure someone can quickly respond to any spam/scam attempts (common with giveaways) – e.g., scammers making fake accounts. Perhaps mention in caption, “We will never ask for credit card info for a free prize. Beware of fake accounts.” (Just a protective measure).

December 14, 2025 – Holiday Traditions Engagement Post

Post Type: Static Image (Question prompt graphic).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A warm, lifestyle photo – e.g., a family or friends in matching pajamas and custom tees around a Christmas tree, or someone lighting a menorah while wearing a fun t-shirt – with a question text overlay: “Tell Us Your Favorite Holiday Tradition!”. Alternatively, an illustration of various holiday symbols (Christmas tree, menorah for Hanukkah which starts tonight, New Year fireworks) with a big question mark in the center. The key is to evoke cozy holiday vibes that resonate across cultures (Christmas and Hanukkah both happening now).

Caption Copy: “🎄 Let’s get festive – what’s your favorite holiday tradition? ✨
We’re feeling all the holiday feels here at GPTees and want to hear from YOU. Do you bake cookies with your family? Light the menorah and eat latkes? Wear matching PJs on Christmas Eve? 🎅🕯️🍪
Share your cherished tradition in the comments! ⬇️ (Feel free to include a photo if you have one – we love seeing them.)
One thing we love is how unique everyone’s celebrations are – kind of like how every GPTees shirt is unique, too. 😉 Whatever you celebrate, we hope you’re having a wonderful season!”

Suggested Hashtags: #HolidayTraditions #FamilyTraditions #Hanukkah2025 (since it begins at sundown) #Christmas2025 #GPTees #HolidaySpirit #SeasonOfJoy. (Use relevant tags for both Christmas and Hanukkah to join those conversations, plus general holiday spirit tags.)

CTA: Here the CTA is community engagement: “Comment below with your tradition.” No hard sell. However, subtly tying uniqueness of traditions to uniqueness of tees plants a brand idea. On Facebook, encourage people to post pictures or stories in comments. This can drive a lot of heartfelt engagement on that platform.

Instagram Story Ideas: Turn it into a story question as well: “What’s your favorite holiday tradition?” using the question sticker. Then repost a few answers (with permission or anonymously) – like “@user1: We host an ugly sweater contest every year!” with a little photo or graphic. Perhaps make a montage story of traditions around the world (if audience is diverse). Also, since Hanukkah starts Dec 14 at sundown, you could include a “Happy Hanukkah” story tonight separately, showing a menorah and saying “Wishing a warm Hanukkah to all who celebrate!”. That would be thoughtful inclusion.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No – This is for engagement and community feeling, not something to advertise. Let it be an organic heartwarming moment. The comments themselves can boost your engagement metrics if lots of people share, which is great.

Collaboration Ideas: If any comments are particularly special, you might later reach out to that person to feature their story (with a tee perhaps). Also, it’s an opportunity to subtly mention collaborations with family: e.g., if someone says matching PJs, you could reply suggesting “Custom shirts could be a new twist!”. Not a formal collab, but conversational. For a brand partnership angle, if you had, say, a hot cocoa mix brand or a charity, you could mention them in context (like “We at GPTees always do a toy drive – shoutout to @ToysForTots”). But mainly, collaborate by responding sincerely to each comment. It shows the human side of GPTees, building loyalty.

December 15, 2025 – Last-Chance Order Push (Urgent Video)

Post Type: Reel or Video (Urgent Announcement).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A dynamic video with text overlays like “Last Chance for Christmas Delivery!” Maybe start with a clip of a ticking clock or an alarm sound. Show a GPTees package being handed to a mail carrier or placed under a tree. Include a friendly team member on camera saying “Hey GPTees fam – we don’t want you to miss out!” in a Santa hat for a personal touch. Use flashing text for “Order by Tonight!” and perhaps have a countdown timer graphic. Could also incorporate a quick montage of product images to entice those who waited (like show a few cool designs from earlier posts to remind them what they could get). End with a big “Midnight 🎯 Dec 15” visual.

Caption Copy: “⌛ It’s the FINAL CALL! ⌛ Today is Dec 15 and that means you have until 11:59 PM tonight to order your GPTees and still get them by Christmas. 🎁
If you’ve been procrastinating (we see you, we’ve been you 😅), now’s the moment. Hop onto GPTees.app, type that brilliant prompt you’ve been mulling over, and we’ll handle the rest – super fast. Your future self (and your gift recipients) will thank you!
P.S. We’re throwing in free priority shipping on all orders placed today to make sure they arrive in time. 🥳 (No code needed – we’ve got you.)
Don’t wait – design now, relax later! And as always, thank you for letting us be part of your holiday. ❤️”

Suggested Hashtags: #LastChance #HolidayRush #FinalCall #GPTees #ChristmasDelivery #Procrastinator #GiftEmergency. (These emphasize urgency and might catch those searching for last-minute solutions).

CTA: “Order by 11:59pm at GPTees.app for Christmas delivery (free rush shipping today only)!” The CTA is very direct: go to site and order now. Highlight the free priority shipping offer to sweeten the deal and remove friction. On Facebook, make sure to include the link and maybe a bold “SHOP NOW” text. Possibly pin this post to the top of your FB page for the day so everyone sees it.

Instagram Story Ideas: Go heavy on Stories: do a countdown sticker for midnight titled “Xmas Order Deadline” (final hours). Create an urgent-looking story design – red background, alarm clock icon, text “Last day to order for Christmas!” and a swipe-up/link. Do a talking-head story of a team member saying “You’ve got a few hours left!” to add a human push. Use link stickers on every story frame directly to the site’s order page. You can also repost the reel to Stories for more views. Consider a fun final poll: “Are you done with shopping or scrambling last minute?” to keep engagement (with option “Just ordered my GPTees! 💪” / “Sending good vibes to future me”).

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Yes – this is a critical conversion moment. Use a one-day ad blast on Facebook/Instagram targeting people who have viewed product pages or added to cart but not purchased (if you have that data via pixel). Also target locals or broad but emphasize “order today”. The free priority shipping is a great ad hook. Use the Reel for an IG Story ad with a swipe up. On Facebook, maybe a carousel ad with product images and the headline “Last Chance for Xmas Delivery – Order by Tonight!” with a shop now button. Put a decent budget just for this short window (e.g., concentrate $100+ in one day if possible) to capture any stragglers.

Collaboration Ideas: Not much collab here – it’s a straightforward brand message. However, you can rope in staff for authenticity, as mentioned (e.g., the team member video). If you have any influencer/partner who can help amplify (maybe someone from earlier collabs posts a story “Hey, don’t forget to order by tonight!” linking to you), that could extend reach. Internally, coordinate customer support to be on standby; maybe mention in caption, “DM us if you have any last-minute questions or need help – we’re here 🔔”. That shows you’re collaborating with your community to get them over the finish line in time.

December 16, 2025 – Production/Office Update (Relief & Thanks)

Post Type: Static Image (Team Photo or Fun Graphic).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A candid photo of the GPTees team celebrating the end of the order rush – maybe everyone in the office or workshop giving a thumbs up or doing a group cheers with coffee. If the team is small, even a selfie of two people with boxes of orders behind them would be charming. Alternatively, if shy on photos, a graphic that says “Thank You for Your Orders!” with maybe an illustration of a stack of boxes being shipped, and small text “we’re working hard to get everything out!”

Caption Copy: “📦 Whew, what a week! We just hit ‘ship’ on the last of the Christmas orders. Thank you to everyone who ordered a GPTees this holiday! 🙏💕 Our team has been working around the clock (powered by hot cocoa and holiday tunes ☕🎶) to make sure your tees arrive in time.
We’re so excited for you to open your one-of-one shirts! Please tag us when you do – we’d love to see those reactions. 😍
For those still joining us on this journey, fear not – while the Xmas cutoff has passed, GPTees is always here for your spontaneous ideas and upcoming occasions. Stick around for more fun… maybe even a New Year surprise. 😉
For now, this tired but happy team is signing off for a well-deserved winter nap. (Just kidding, we’re already planning the next cool thing!)
Thanks for making our first holiday season amazing. – Team GPTees”

Suggested Hashtags: #ThankYou #TeamGPTees #WeDidIt #StartupLife #HolidayRush #Grateful #CustomerLove. (Express gratitude and team spirit).

CTA: This post is mainly to build goodwill. CTA could be soft: “Stay tuned for New Year deals and keep designing at GPTees.app!” Encourage tagging as above for UGC. On Facebook, you could even make this more of a “thank you community” note pinned for a day.

Instagram Story Ideas: Share a quick story of the team high-fiving or a boomerang of everyone saying “Thank you!”. If not available, do a text story: “All Christmas orders are out! 🙌 Time to exhale. Thank you all!” with a group selfie if possible. Maybe run a quick fun poll: “How many cups of coffee did our team drink making your shirts?” as a light-hearted behind-the-scenes quiz (options like “50?” “100??” then reveal something silly). Also a story to remind “Even though Christmas orders are done, you can still order GPTees for birthdays, events, or just because – no bad time for creativity!”.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No need – this is more personal and meant for existing followers. Save ad budget for forward-looking campaigns (like post-Christmas or New Year).

Collaboration Ideas: Tag team members in the photo if they’re okay with it (gives a face to the brand). This is internal collaboration celebration. You might also tag a thanks to any partners (e.g., “Huge thanks to our print partner [Company] for hustling with us!” or to the local post office if you want to be cheeky). This shows you share credit and fosters good B2B relationships. It’s also nice to individually reply to commenters who say thanks or congrats on this post, continuing that warm community feel.

December 18, 2025 – “Ugly Sweater Day” Themed Post

(National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day is Fri, Dec 19, but we’ll post a day early to get folks ready.)

Post Type: Reel or Carousel (Ugly Sweater Day fun).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: Showcase how GPTees can join the Ugly Sweater craze. If a Reel: do a comedic skit – someone is about to go to an ugly sweater party but doesn’t have a sweater, so they quickly generate an ugly-sweater t-shirt with GPTees. Show the person receiving the shirt and rocking it at the party while everyone else wears sweaters, making them the quirky star. Use a humorous audio clip, maybe a popular holiday comedy sound. If a carousel: include images of the ugliest holiday designs you can concoct on a tee – like ridiculous mashups (e.g., a T-Rex wearing a tacky Christmas sweater, giant glittery lettering, clashing colors). One slide can read “Ugly Sweater Tee?” as a question. This is a chance to be over-the-top.

Caption Copy: “👹🎄 Ugly Sweater Day… but make it a tee! 🎄👹 Tomorrow is National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day, and we couldn’t resist getting in on the fun – GPTees style. Why limit the ugly to sweaters when you can print one-of-a-kind cringe on a T-SHIRT? 😜
We cooked up some truly horrendous (read: amazing) designs using our AI: think candy-cane puke backgrounds, Santa riding a unicorn with clashing colors, and random tinsel everywhere. Honestly, they’re so bad they’re good. 😂
Would you rock an ugly sweater tee at your holiday party? If you’ve got a nutty idea, throw it at GPTees.app and see what comes out! (We dare you.)
Share your ugliest creation with us. And don’t forget to wear something utterly ugly-cute tomorrow – you have our full support. 🙈❤️

Suggested Hashtags: #UglyChristmasSweater #UglySweaterDay #UglySweaterParty #GPTees #HolidayHumor #TackyChristmas #SoBadItsGood. (These will tag into the popular ugly sweater trend which gets traction mid-December.)

CTA: “Try designing an ugly sweater tee on GPTees.app – it’s free entertainment 😆 and who knows, you might end up with a fabulously awful shirt for tomorrow’s party!” The CTA here is playful, encouraging using the app creatively. Even if it’s not a serious purchase driver, it’s engaging usage driver. On IG, say link in bio; on FB, direct link. Also CTA: “Post your ugly sweater (or tee) and tag us – we’d love to rate it!” to prompt UGC.

Instagram Story Ideas: Run an Ugly Sweater contest on Stories: Ask followers today to submit pics of their wild holiday sweaters (or tees). Use the question sticker “Show us your ugly sweater!” and then repost the entries in a montage tomorrow with a poll for “Ugliest of all?”. Or simply tomorrow do a poll series: share a few ugly sweater images (from web or from submissions) and let people vote which is ugliest. Tie it back: “Imagine these on a tee… oh wait, you can!” with a link. Also do a countdown or reminder that tomorrow is Ugly Sweater Day, encouraging everyone to dress up and share.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This is more for fun and engagement. If the Reel is hilarious and you want to share holiday cheer, you could target it as a lighthearted ad to broad audiences (people might find it funny and remember GPTees). But it’s not a direct sales push, so only boost if you see organic success and have spare budget.

Collaboration Ideas: Engage your audience by featuring their ugly sweater creations. Perhaps promise to repost the best ones (as mentioned). For external collab, maybe tag or challenge a friendly brand: e.g., tweet or story to an ugly sweater retailer joking “We’ll stick to tees, but we see your work @UglySweaterBrand 😉.” Or collab with a local charity if any ugly sweater events are for charity (common) – offer to donate a portion of any “ugly tee” orders to that cause. It’s late in season for that, but even a mention like “Today we donated a box of clothes to XYZ charity to spread warmth” can connect. Mainly, collaborate with followers for a fun community day.

December 19, 2025 – Spotlight: Best Community Designs of 2025

Post Type: Carousel (Year-in-Review showcase).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: “Top 5 Designs of 2025” chosen from community creations (with permission). Each slide: a compelling photo or mockup of a GPTees shirt that was created by a user this year. These could be the most liked on social, or staff picks for creativity. Number each slide (“#1”, “#2”, etc. or do a countdown 5 to 1). If possible, include the prompt in text on the slide (“Prompt: …”) and credit the creator (e.g., “Designed by @username”). Make the first slide a title card: “🔥 Top Community Designs of 2025” with a collage thumbnail of the shirts to entice swiping.

Caption Copy: “✨ GPTees 2025 Hall of Fame! ✨ As the year winds down, we’re celebrating YOU – our creative community. Here are 5 standout designs from GPTees users that blew us away this year:
#5: [Description of design #5 in a sentence — e.g., “Galaxy Cat – literally, a cosmic kitty generated by @spaceartlover. This one left us starry-eyed! 💫”]
#4: [Description of #4 — e.g., “Grandpa’s Quote – @johnsmith turned his grandpa’s favorite saying into a tee. Wholesome and stylish. 🥰”]
#3: … etc.
#1: [Description of #1 — make this one really shine, e.g., “Dragon Santa – Created by @coolnerd, this prompt ‘Santa riding a dragon’ became an epic tee that we’re STILL talking about. 🐉🎅🔥”]
There were SO many amazing designs (every GPTees is unique, after all). It was hard to choose! Thank you all for unleashing your imaginations with us. We can’t wait to see what you’ll create in 2026. 🚀

Suggested Hashtags: #YearInReview #TopDesigns #GPTees #CommunitySpotlight #BestOf2025 #MadeByUsers #CreativeCommunity. (Showcasing it’s a community-driven highlight reel).

CTA: “Which of these designs is your favorite? Drop the number below! And if you have an idea brewing, remember – you could be on next year’s list 😉 Visit GPTees.app to make your dream tee.” This invites engagement (ranking by commenting) and nudges new creations. On Facebook, encourage people to vote or even share their own favorites if they were customers (“Post a pic of a tee you made this year!”).

Instagram Story Ideas: Share each top design in a story series, using the poll feature: “Do you love this design? Yes/No” or a rating slider. At the end, do a story asking “What would you create in 2026?” with the question sticker to hype future participation. Maybe also do a short video of a team member saying “Thanks for an awesome year of designs!” as the finale of the story set.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – This is primarily a community pat-on-the-back. However, it does showcase product examples in a compelling way. If you wanted, you could repurpose these images in future ads (with permission) to show real user creativity. For instance, a New Year campaign ad might say “Look what our users created – your idea could be next!” But the post itself can remain organic.

Collaboration Ideas: Celebrate the users: tag them, shout them out, maybe send a DM with a small thank-you (like a discount code for being featured). This strengthens customer loyalty. Additionally, this could catch media eyes – maybe pitch a local news bit “Startup shares top AI shirt designs of the year” (not a direct collab, but PR-ish). Internally, it’s a collaboration between marketing and customer success – ensure those featured are okay with it. This post can also be cross-posted to LinkedIn or a blog to showcase the year’s creativity (wider content strategy).

December 24, 2025 – Christmas Eve Greetings & Last-Minute Gift Idea

Post Type: Static Image (Festive Greeting + Subtle promo).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A heartwarming graphic or photo: maybe a flatlay of a GPTees shirt wrapped as a gift under a Christmas tree with lights glowing, or the GPTees logo drawn in snow in a picturesque scene, or simply a graphic with Santa and GPTees branding wishing happy holidays. Possibly incorporate text: “Merry Christmas from GPTees!” in a nice script. Not too promotional – more of a warm greeting visual.

Caption Copy: “🎄 Merry Christmas Eve! 🎄 As we count down the hours to Christmas, all of us at GPTees want to wish you a holiday full of joy, warmth, and creativity. Whether you’re wearing a one-of-one tee at tonight’s gathering or saving the surprise for tomorrow morning, we hope it brings a smile. 🙂
We’re feeling extra grateful for our community today. Thank you for an incredible season and for welcoming us into your holiday traditions. ❤️
(P.S. Need a super last-minute gift? Our digital gift cards are instant – truly zero sleigh required! 🛷💨 Available on our website if you’re in a pinch.)
Stay cozy and have a magical Christmas! – The GPTees Team ✨

Suggested Hashtags: #MerryChristmas #ChristmasEve #HappyHolidays #GPTees #Grateful #HolidayGreetings #SeasonsGreetings. (Common holiday tags plus brand for anyone browsing holiday wishes).

CTA: This is mainly a holiday greeting, so the CTA is soft: the mention of digital gift cards is one (if you have them, this is where to plug them as a last-resort gift). “Find digital gift cards at GPTees.app” for FB with link, and on IG maybe mention link in bio or simply say available on site. But keep it secondary to the greeting.

Instagram Story Ideas: Post a warm animated Story – a fireplace crackling, or falling snow with “Merry Christmas from GPTees!” text. Perhaps show a quick clip of a team member (or even you) saying “Happy Holidays!”. If you have customer photos of GPTees gifts under trees or being unwrapped (some might have come in by now), feature a couple (with permission) in Stories as a feel-good montage. Also, remind about digital gift cards in one story panel: “Need a last-minute gift? 🎁 E-gift cards to the rescue on GPTees.app!” with a link sticker.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No – Holiday greetings are best left organic. Most people aren’t shopping on the night of Dec 24; this is about brand goodwill. Save budget for post-Christmas or New Year campaigns.

Collaboration Ideas: If you partner with any charity or cause during the holidays, you could mention it here, e.g., “This season, we donated to [Cause] to share the love.” That shows values and could be a soft collab with a nonprofit (if not, no worries). Also, if any influencer or partner gave you a holiday shout-out, you might repost it in Stories or mention “Special thanks to @soandso for supporting us this year.” It’s about wrapping up the season with gratitude all around.

December 25, 2025 – Merry Christmas & UGC Celebration

Post Type: Static Image or Short Video (Holiday Celebration/UGC).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: A collage of user-generated photos of people opening or wearing GPTees gifts on Christmas morning (if you can get a couple quickly!). Perhaps 3-4 candid pics (tagged or sent by customers) arranged nicely with a “Merry Christmas” overlay. If no real UGC is available that fast, use a single heartwarming stock-like photo that implies family joy (child opening gift, etc.) with a subtle GPTees logo in corner or a GPTees shirt visible on someone. Alternatively, an animation of a gift box opening with a t-shirt popping out and confetti.

Caption Copy: “🎁 Merry Christmas from GPTees! 🎁 We hope today is filled with laughter, love, and maybe a few surprise tees under the tree. 😉
Seeing our community unwrap shirts that you dreamed up has been the highlight of our year. To those who got a GPTees gift – we can’t wait to hear what you think! And to those who didn’t yet – there’s always a reason for a fun tee in the new year. 😇
Thank you for bringing us into your homes and celebrations. Enjoy this special day and make wonderful memories. From our small GPTees family to yours, Happy Holidays and cheers to a bright new year ahead! 🥂✨

Suggested Hashtags: #MerryChristmas #HappyHolidays #ChristmasDay #GPTees #UnwrapJoy #OneOfOne #ThankYou. (Mix of holiday and brand sentiments).

CTA: No strong CTA – it’s more of a heartfelt message. Perhaps a gentle, “If you got a GPTees today, tag us in a pic or story – we’d love to see! 📸”. On Facebook, you can encourage people to share photos in comments of their gifts. This nudges UGC without pushing a sale.

Instagram Story Ideas: Post any UGC you gather: re-share people’s stories who tagged you opening their shirts or wearing them (this content might be coming in through the day). If someone posts “Thanks GPTees for this awesome gift!” – share that with a thank-you sticker. Create a highlight later for these. Also do a story simply saying “Merry Christmas! ✨” with a nice graphic, as many brands do. Maybe a quick behind-the-scenes of your team if anyone is working/supporting on the day saying thanks.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No – let’s not run ads on Christmas Day; people are with family. This is pure organic feel-good content.

Collaboration Ideas: This is collaboration with your customers by featuring them. If you prepared well, you might have even coordinated with a couple of loyal customers in advance to get a photo of them by the tree with their tee to post today (if so, credit them!). Also, internally, maybe a message from the founder or team (if the founder’s face is known, could have them deliver the caption message as a short video). Essentially, it’s the culmination of the community collaboration we’ve fostered all month.

December 26, 2025 – “Share Your GPTees Gifts!” Call-to-Action

Post Type: Static Image (Call for UGC).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: An image with a mix of user photos (if available) of people wearing their new GPTees, or a nice graphic with a camera icon and text “Got a GPTees gift? Share a pic!”. You could design it like a Polaroid picture pinboard with placeholders of t-shirt images and one highlighted photo of a smiling customer. Alternatively, a simple brightly colored background with bold text: “Show off your GPTees!” and a hashtag.

Caption Copy: “📸 Show and Tell Time! Did you unwrap a GPTees under the tree? Or did you gift one and see an epic reaction? We want to see! 😃
Drop a photo in the comments or tag us in your post/story wearing your new GPTees creation. Nothing makes our day more than seeing our tees in the wild, especially knowing the fun stories behind them.
To sweeten the deal, we’ll randomly select one person who shares their pic to win a $25 GPTees credit for your next design (got New Year ideas, anyone?). 💡
Can’t wait to see you rock those one-of-one shirts – whether they’re hilarious, heartfelt, or anywhere in between. Thanks again for an amazing holiday season!”

Suggested Hashtags: #GPTeesUnwrapped #ShowUsYourTee #GiftReaction #UGC #CustomerPics #HolidayHaul #GPTees. (Encourage a dedicated hashtag like GPTeesUnwrapped to track submissions, plus general ones to get visibility).

CTA: The entire post is a CTA for user content: “Tag @GPTees or use #GPTeesUnwrapped to share.” Also mention the incentive clearly: share and possibly win credit (if budget allows a small giveaway; if not, just the feature is the incentive). On Facebook, explicitly ask for photo comments (since that platform makes it easy: “Share a photo in the comments of you with your GPTees!”). This can spark a nice thread of images.

Instagram Story Ideas: Create a Story template for UGC – like a blank where users can fill in. Or simply repost every tag you get of people with shirts, with permission. If volume is low, make a story saying “We’d love to see you in your GPTees! Tag us 😊” with an example from maybe an employee wearing a shirt they got. If you see great posts, DM the users for permission to repost on feed in coming days. Essentially use Stories to amplify this call and instantly share any responses.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No – this is community-driven. We want genuine shares, which won’t come from ads. Instead, focus on engagement; maybe extend the life of this post by commenting and interacting so it stays in feeds.

Collaboration Ideas: This invites collaboration with customers as content creators. You could also involve an influencer who got a GPTees (if you gifted any influencers shirts, ask them to share now). If you have relationships with micro-influencers or even employees with social followings, encourage them to model their shirt on their own profiles now (organic influence). Possibly coordinate with that earlier contest winner from Dec 12 or any notable participant to share their winnings now. This collective sharing acts as social proof and free promotion as friends of friends see GPTees being enjoyed.

December 28, 2025 – New Year’s Eve Tees & Resolutions

Post Type: Carousel or Reel (New Year themed content).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: Focus on New Year’s and 2026. If carousel: Slide 1 asks “What’s your 2026 Motto?” with a flashy “2026” graphic. Slides 2-4 show example t-shirts with fun New Year themes: e.g., Slide 2: a tee that says “New Year, New Me (Same Love for T-Shirts)” in cool typography with fireworks; Slide 3: an AI-generated image tee depicting something like “2026 astronaut” for a futuristic vibe; Slide 4: maybe a humorous resolution tee like “Gym? Maybe Tomorrow – 2026 resolution 🤣”. If a Reel: a quick cut compilation of designs or text that change to reflect 2026 resolutions or jokes, with celebratory music. Possibly use the “Happy New Year” sound or trending audio.

Caption Copy: “🎉 2026 is around the corner 🎉 – what slogan or vibe are you bringing into the new year? Why not wear it on a tee! 😁 Here are some New Year-themed ideas we whipped up: motivational, funny, and futuristic.
From serious resolutions (💪 “Stronger in 2026”) to tongue-in-cheek ones (🍕 “Will Work Out for Pizza – 2026”), GPTees can put your 2026 mood on your chest, literally.
How about you: any words or themes guiding you in the new year? Let us know! Maybe we’ll even create a design for our fave comment. 😉
As we gear up to celebrate, remember you can instantly manifest your 2026 mantra into a shirt – start the year with a statement piece! ✨👕

Suggested Hashtags: #NewYear2026 #NewYearsEve #NewYearNewMe #Resolution #GPTees #2026Fashion #NYE. (Mix trending New Year tags and brand).

CTA: “Design a 2026 tee now at GPTees.app and wear your resolution!” Encourage them to actually create something for the New Year (perhaps to wear on NYE or as motivation for January). Also CTA to engage: “Comment your 2026 motto – we might pick one idea to turn into a free tee!” (yet another mini incentive to keep interaction going during the typically slow week).

Instagram Story Ideas: Do a question sticker: “What’s your 2026 motto or resolution in 3 words?” – then repost the most interesting ones as text over a cool background. Maybe even live-design one: pick one submission and quickly create a design on the app, screenshot it, and share “Look, we made it for you @user!”. Also a countdown sticker for New Year’s Eve party time on Dec 31. You could also poll: “Are you going out or staying in for NYE?” to keep things interactive and light.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: Low – People might be in a shopping lull between Christmas and New Year, but some might spend gift money. If you have an ad budget left, consider a New Year sale ad or “gift card” promo rather than boosting this post. However, if this carousel has a strong call to action, you could run it as an ad to people who got new devices or are active after Christmas (some brands do target the Dec 26-30 window for people who have time to browse). Emphasize “use your holiday money on something fun!” if you do. But boosting this exact post is optional.

Collaboration Ideas: Maybe partner with a motivational coach or wellness influencer for a resolution-themed collab. For instance, have them share their motto on a GPTees shirt. If you can’t arrange that, at least engage any comment from a verified or notable person – it might happen spontaneously (people are reflective this time of year). Also, collaborate with your design team to possibly launch a couple of preset New Year designs on the site – mention if you have a collection (like “Check out our limited edition 2026 designs”). This can cross-sell existing products if any.

December 31, 2025 – Happy New Year Message & Wrap-up

Post Type: Static Image or Video (New Year’s celebration).

Visual/Asset Suggestion: Something celebratory and on-brand: maybe a short animated video with “Happy New Year 2026!” where the zero in 2026 is a GPTees logo or a t-shirt icon exploding like a firework. Or a static graphic with fireworks, champagne, and text “Happy 2026 from GPTees!”. Possibly include a subtle call-out like “see you next year”. If any team members are together, a quick team video yelling “Happy New Year!” could be gold for authenticity.

Caption Copy: “🥂 Happy New Year! 🥂 2026 is here (well, almost, depending on when you read this). We want to end this year by saying THANK YOU. Launching GPTees and seeing all your creativity in 2025 has been incredible. From wild prompts to heartfelt gifts, you made this community something special.
We have big dreams for 2026 and can’t wait to have you along for the ride. Expect more fun features, more ways to express yourself, and of course, more awesome tees. 😉
Here’s to a creative and bright 2026 for everyone! Stay safe tonight, have a blast, and we’ll catch you next year with fresh ideas. 🎇
Cheers and happy New Year from the GPTees family! 🎉🎊

Suggested Hashtags: #HappyNewYear #Welcome2026 #NewYearsEve #GPTees #ThankYou #YearEnd #Celebrate. (Common NYE tags + brand).

CTA: No direct sales CTA – this is a goodwill and forward-looking message. If anything: “See you in 2026 – and as always, you can bring any crazy idea to life at GPTees.app. 🎆”. It subtly reminds them the site is there for their fun. Maybe also: “Tell us one thing you’re looking forward to in 2026!” to prompt some comments (keeping engagement up even on a holiday).

Instagram Story Ideas: Definitely do a countdown sticker to midnight. Maybe post a short clip of fireworks or a Happy New Year GIF when the time hits. If any team/founder video wishing HNY was made, put it on Stories too. Possibly a quick montage of highlights from the year (you could reuse snippets from previous posts like the top designs, behind scenes laughs, etc., if you have time to compile a “Year in Review” story). Save it as a 2025 Highlight for posterity.

Paid Promo/Boost Option: No – everyone’s busy celebrating. This isn’t a time for ads. We’ll start fresh with campaigns in the new year.

Collaboration Ideas: Mark the new year by tagging partners or supporters: “Shoutout to all our partners and friends who helped us this year (you know who you are!)”. If you had any brand collabs or influencer relationships, a quick thank-you mention in stories or comments would be classy. Also, encourage collaboration into the new year: “Our DMs are open for any collab ideas in 2026 – hit us up!” (if you actively seek partnerships). Mostly, this is a wrap-up of the collaborative, community-building tone we’ve carried through December.

Sources: Incorporating holiday e-commerce best practices such as consistent daily engagement, leveraging user-generated content (86% of millennials trust UGC), strategic use of interactive Stories (polls, countdowns, etc., as 62% of people become more interested in a brand after seeing it in Stories), and using targeted hashtag clusters rather than too many generic tags. All content keeps a warm, participatory tone, encouraging followers to interact and feel part of the GPTees journey. Let’s make this holiday season both memorable for our audience and impactful for our brand – one creative post at a time. 🎉
