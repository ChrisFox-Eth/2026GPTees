# Shop page copy & layout polish

## Goal
Clarify the shop hero messaging, simplify badges, and adjust CTAs per feedback.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the shop hero heading/subheading in `frontend/src/pages/ShopPage.tsx` to focus on creating a fit/custom apparel (replace "Shop Custom Apparel" and intro copy accordingly).
- [ ] Restyle or relocate the "Super-soft GPTee" and "Flexible pay options" badges so they read as informational chips distinct from product selection bubbles.
- [ ] Change the primary product CTA text to the requested phrasing (e.g., "Check out your design") instead of "Make this yours" where appropriate.
- [ ] Ensure the adjustments remain responsive across breakpoints.
