# GPTees Conversion Boost Plan

**Purpose:** High-impact conversion/UX tickets to launch paid traffic confidently. Tickets live in `conversion-boost-plan/tickets/` and are ordered by urgency/impact. No code is implemented here—each ticket is a scoped work item.

## Ticket index (ordered)
1. `001-quickstart-design-now.md` — frictionless first action with prefilled tee + prompt CTA
2. `002-social-proof-strip.md` — trust strip with rotating blurbs
3. `003-pricing-clarity.md` — clear Basic vs Premium value and risk reducers
4. `004-checkout-included-upsell.md` — “What’s included” + “Why Premium?” in cart/checkout
5. `005-real-mockups.md` — swap product imagery to real Bella 3001 mockups
6. `006-examples-gallery.md` — small “See examples” gallery near modal/hero
7. `007-delivery-estimate.md` — show delivery ETA near pay CTA
8. `008-design-limit-messaging.md` — confirm Basic=1/Premium=unlimited in cart/checkout
9. `009-shipping-form-streamline.md` — streamline shipping form (hide phone; show only when needed)
10. `010-bundle-upsell-polish.md` — refine bundle toggle messaging and display in cart
